- ***Build Batch & Streaming Pipelines in Hours*** -> Drag-and-drop UI for connecting sources to destinations with transformations. Build, preview, debug and schedule from a single interface.
- ***Execute at Enterprise Scale*** -> Deploy in your data center or on AWS, Azure or GCP. Scale via YARN, Mesos or Kubernetes. Even execute on edge devices or servers.
- ***Map and Monitor Runtime Performance*** -> Track throughput, latency, error rates and more. Enforce Data SLAs. Drill into live map to pinpoint problems.
- ***Protect Sensitive Data as it Arrives*** -> Set policies to detect PII in-stream via pattern matching.  Hide, hash or quarantine data for GDPR and HIPAA compliance.
